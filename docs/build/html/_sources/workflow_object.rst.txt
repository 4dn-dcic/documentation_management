Create Workflow Object
=======================

In order to implement the pipeline in the data portal, it is necessary to create
a workflow object. Test your workflow in webdev first. Upload your workflow and test files. Since
this will be tested with tibanna, you can use bigger test files than the ones used in the travis
test. You need also to create file formats and software objects
in case they do not exists in the system.

Example:

You can find the bedtomultivec workflow.json `here <https://github.com/4dn-dcic/documentation_management/blob/master/docs/source/files/bedtomultivec_workflow_v4.json>`_

Here is a `template <https://github.com/4dn-dcic/documentation_management/blob/master/docs/source/files/workflow.json>`_
you can use.
