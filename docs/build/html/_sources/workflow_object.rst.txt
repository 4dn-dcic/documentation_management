Create Workflow Object
=======================

Use the following template to create a workflow.json object.
First test your workflow in webdev, upload your workflow and test files. Since
this will be test with tibanna, bigger test files than the ones used in the travis
test can be used. You need also to create file formats and software objects
in case they do not exists in the system.

Example:

You can find the bedtomultivec workflow.json `here <https://github.com/4dn-dcic/documentation_management/blob/master/docs/source/files/bedtomultivec_workflow_v4.json>`_

Here is a `template <https://github.com/4dn-dcic/documentation_management/blob/master/docs/source/files/workflow.json>`_'
